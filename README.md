## 🔒 Security

- **Authentication**: Username/password required (admin/admin by default)
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions with secret key
- **Local Access**: Runs on localhost by default
- **Read-Only**: Dashboard only reads data, doesn't modify system

**⚠️ Important**: Change the default credentials in production!

Edit `app.py`:
```python
USERNAME = 'your_username'
PASSWORD = 'your_secure_password'
```
