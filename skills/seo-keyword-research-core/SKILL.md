# SEO Keyword Research Skill Instructions (Content & Trend Aware)

### Skill Name
seo-keyword-research-core

### Description
This skill is responsible for discovering high-impact SEO keywords by deeply understanding the project's content, domain, and offerings, and aligning them with current Google search trends.
The goal is to identify keywords that have high search potential, strong relevance, and realistic ranking opportunities.

This skill focuses on **keyword intelligence**, not content writing.

---

## Core Objective

Generate SEO keywords that:
- Are highly relevant to the project's actual content
- Match real user search intent
- Have strong ranking potential
- Can realistically improve organic traffic

---

## Step 1: Content Understanding (MANDATORY)

Before searching keywords, the skill must:
- Understand what the project actually offers
- Identify core services, products, and domains
- Avoid generic or unrelated keywords
- Align keywords strictly with real content

Never search keywords without content understanding.

---

## Step 2: Keyword Intent Classification

All keywords must be classified into intent types:

- Informational (learn, guide, benefits)
- Commercial (comparison, best, price)
- Transactional (buy, dealer, provider)
- Navigational (brand, product-specific)

Intent must match page purpose.

## Step 3: Google Search Trend Alignment

Keyword discovery must consider:
- Current search behavior
- Industry-relevant trending phrases
- Long-tail keyword opportunities
- Location-aware variations (if applicable)

Focus on:
- High relevance over raw volume
- Keywords people actually type
- Avoid vanity keywords with no intent

---

## Step 4: Keyword Expansion Strategy

For each core keyword:
- Generate variations
- Generate long-tail forms
- Generate question-based queries
- Generate comparison-based queries

Example categories:
- Primary keyword
- Supporting keywords
- Semantic keywords
- FAQ-style keywords

---

## Step 5: Competition & Feasibility Awareness

For each keyword:
- Estimate competition level (high / medium / low)
- Avoid impossible-to-rank keywords early
- Prefer realistic ranking opportunities
- Balance short-tail and long-tail keywords

This skill favors **rankability over hype**.

---

## Step 6: Page Mapping Readiness

Keywords must be suitable for:
- Category pages
- Product pages
- Service pages
- Blog / informational pages

Each keyword must clearly map to a page type.

---

## Output Format Requirements

The output must include:
- Keyword list grouped by intent
- Priority level (high / medium / low)
- Suggested page type
- Short reasoning for why keyword is chosen

Output must be structured and reusable.

---

## Response Rules

- Never suggest keywords unrelated to actual content
- Prefer relevance over volume

- Think like a real search user
- Be realistic and data-driven

---

## What Not to Do
